A better jQuery tabs plugin

This is a tight little jQuery tabs plugin that will activate and prevent scroll on load when there’s a URL hash, or do nothing if the hash isn’t one the tabs. It’ll also check if there are links to other tabs in the content. It’s got object literal organization and a little fun progressive enhancement.
